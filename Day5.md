# Day5 Summary

## if statement
conditional statements like in any other programming language.

## Conditional ternary operator
it is a "shortcut" operator for writing quick conditionals
it needs 3 values to work:
```javascript
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
```

## Loops in J
to loop through number of iterations, it's implimented like any other programming language.


## Map 
map calls a function on each item in an array to create a new array.
example: 
```javascript
const nicknames = spices.map(s => s.nickname + " Spice");
```

## Filter 
filter calls a true/false function on each item and creates a new array with only the items where the function returns true.
example:
```javascript
const mels = spices.filter(s => s.name.includes("Mel"));
```
## Spread 
It lets us take all the items in an array and spread them around.
example:
```javascript
const oldBurns = ["square", "wack"];
const newBurns = ["basic", "dusty", "sus"];
const burnBook = [...oldBurns, ...newBurns];
```
