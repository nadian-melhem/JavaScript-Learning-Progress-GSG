# Day6 Summary

## Data Fethcing and  Promises 
**fetch()** lets us use JS to load data from APIs, but It takes time to fetch data from the network ad then return as **Promise**, which is a return type tell us that the data will be there soon, this is why we use **await** to tell JS to stop and wait for an asynchronous operation to finish.

## Destructuring
it is a fancy way of declaring multiple variables at once, By "extracting" values from an object with their property names.

## Async Functions
Async allows us to write promises-based code as if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread.

## Modules 
Modules let us split big codebases across multiple files and it's different from script in multiple ways.

##  Import & Export
- **Export** lets us expose variables from our module's scope to the outside world
- **Import** lets us use an exposed variable from another module
